   
   eg:
   ("Aries", "Leo"): "Highly Compatible",
        ("Aries", "Libra"): "Moderately Compatible",
        ("Aries", "Capricorn"): "Not Very Compatible",
        # Add more compatibility rules as needed..

# Define Zodiac Compatibility: Research and establish rules or guideline
#  for zodiac compatibility. You might base this on traditional astrological beliefs about which 
#  signs are compatible with each other.

# Implement Compatibility Logic: Write Python code that checks the compatibility between
#  two given zodiac signs based on the rules you defined. This could involve comparing the elements or
#  other attributes associated with each sign.


# Create User Interface: Design a simple user interface where users can
#  input their zodiac signs and see the compatibility result.

writer = csv.DictWriter(csvfile, fieldnames=fields)

# csv.DictWriter(): This is a class provided by the csv module in Python. 
# It's used to write dictionaries into CSV files.

# csvfile: This parameter specifies the file object (or file-like object) where 
# the CSV data will be written. It's the file that you've opened using the open() function.

# fieldnames: This parameter specifies the field names (i.e., column names) for the CSV file.
#  It's a list of strings where each string represents a column header.
#   These field names are used to map keys in the dictionaries to the corresponding columns in the CSV file.

# So, when you create a DictWriter object, you're essentially setting up 
# a CSV writer that expects to receive dictionaries as input, where the keys of each dictionary 
# correspond to the field names specified in the fieldnames parameter. The values associated with 
# these keys will be written into the corresponding columns in the CSV file.
