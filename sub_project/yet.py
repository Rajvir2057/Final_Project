#I want to form a cute word game using count(), like i mean it will do this see yea,

# name1= input("Enter your name here please: ")
# name_count1= name1.count(name)
# print(name_count1)

# name2= input("Enter your name here please: ")
# name_count2= name2.count()
# print(name_count2)

# def division(name_count1,name_count2):
#     return name_count1//name_count2
#     print(f"the divided output is: {name_count1} {name_count2}")
# division()
